Bindy
=====

About
-----

Bindy is a lightweight cross-platform framework for cloud service written in C++ language. We haven't found any lightweight solutions to create stable peer-to-peer networks with encryption. A lot of great and big projects aim at either distributed cloud calculation, file sharing, or messaging. We do not aim to solve any of these tasks, but to provide easy-to-use, cross-platform, and well documented C++ library to **bind** computers into a cloud network, that can keep and synchronize arbitrary data, manage access rules, and encrypt connections.

This project is developed in EPC-MSU by professional developers for internal purposes. The project was created originally free, since we earn money from other products. Let this code be used for good.

Components
----------

Bindy is based on several open-source solutions.
* Crypto++. It manages encryption and cross-platform sockets.
* TinyThread++. Cross-platform solution for multithreading. 
* SQLite. Data storage and inquiry.

License

Bindy is published under the most open license possible. Call it MIT license or public domain, whatever suits your country rules.
